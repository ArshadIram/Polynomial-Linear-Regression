# Polynomial-Linear-Regression

Scenario:
Suppose, you the HR team of a company wants to verify the past working details of a new potential employee that they are going to hire. However, they get information about only 10 salaries in their positions.

With this, the HR team can relate to the person’s position say level 6.5, and can check if the employee has been bluffing about his old salary.

Hence, we will be building a bluffy – detector. 

Why Polynomial Regression called polynomial linear regression?
Even though it has huge powers, it is still called linear. This is because when we talk about linear, we don’t look at it from the point of view of the x-variable. We talk about coefficients.

Y is a function of X. Can this function be expressed as a linear combination of coefficients because ultimately used to plugin X and predict Y.

Hence, by just looking at the equation from the coefficients point of view, makes it linear. Interesting right?

Now we will look at an example to understand how to perform this regression.
